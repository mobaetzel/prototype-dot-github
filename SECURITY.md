# Security policy

## Supported versions
The latest release is the only release we support (with security patches). We **don't** support any other release.  
If there is a security patch there will be a new release.

## Reporting a vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability by contacting us via email at [development@aivot.de](mailto:development@aivot.de?subject=[SECURITY]).
