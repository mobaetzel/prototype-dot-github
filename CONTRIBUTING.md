Maybe we should elaborate on our branching technique and refer to our conventions such as tagging,
commit messages, typescript and other language (style) conventions etc.

We should only accept pull requests for existing issues. Existing issues have been discussed and if not
closed deemed good for implementation. Otherwise we may risk someone creating features we don't want
and then giving us hate for not accepting the pull request.
