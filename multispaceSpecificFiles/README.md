# What is MultiSpace?
MultiSpace is a visual resource booking platform for quick and easy booking of work resources.  
We enable organizations to:
- work hybrid in flexible office environments
- keep track of who has booked which desk
- book work resources easily
- obtain transparency over resources

# Who uses MultiSpace?
Currently top secret. If you want to get an introduction into using MultiSpace contact us at <https://aivot.de/kontakt>.




# Setup
MultiSpace was developed as a cloud native application and works best with Docker.
You can find more Information on the [DockerHub page of MultiSpace](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mobaetzel/multispace).
If you want to deploy MultiSpace without docker, read more at the [native setup section](./README.md#Native-Setup).


## Docker Setup
If you have docker-compose installed, simply start the `docker-compose.yml` below by running `docker-compose up`.
MultiSpace is now available at <http://localhost:8000>.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:14.2
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: multispace
      POSTGRES_USER: multispace
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: multispaceftw1
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  multispace:
    image: mobaetzel/multispace:latest
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      DSKR_PG_HOST: db
      DSKR_PG_PORT: 5432
      DSKR_PG_USER: multispace
      DSKR_PG_PASSWORD: multispaceftw1
      DSKR_PG_DATABASE: multispace
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
```


## Native Setup
**The guide for a native setup was made for unix platforms only.**
This results in the lack of support for the windows platform of gunicorn.


### Prerequisites
The native setup includes compiling the project and running it afterwards behind a nginx reverse proxy.
MultiSpace depends on a set of open source tools and technologies to compile and run.

- Python >= 3.9
- Postgresql >= 14.2
- gunicorn >= 20.1


### Fetching dependencies
After cloning this repository, open up a shell inside the root of the project.
You should create a virtual environment and fetch all required dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv ./.venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install gunicorn
```


### Configure nginx
Replace you default nginx config file at `/etc/nginx/http.d/default.conf` with the following content:

```
server {
    listen 80;

    location /static/ {
        root /path/to/the/cloned/repository;
    }

     location /media/ {
        root /path/to/the/cloned/repository;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```


### Running MultiSpace
You need to perform several actions when running MultiSpace for the first time.

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

These commands will require you to create a new superuser account to manage your installation.
After you've run the provision commands, you can start the MultiSpace server.
Run the following command to start the MultiSpace:

```bash
gunicorn multispace.wsgi --bind 127.0.0.1:8000 --workers 3
```

The MultiSpace server should now be available at <http://localhost>.
